1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:04,780
The Snap store provides four channels into which your software can be released.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,040
They're named stable, candidate, beta and edge.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,480
Each channel conveys a level of risk to the user

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,320
so software published there should be of an appropriate stability.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,980
As a developer you can publish different releases of your snap to each channel

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,580
Automatically publish directly from each Github commit

7
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,120
to the edge channel from build.snapcraft.io,

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,620
from Travis, or manually using the snapcraft command.

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,940
Take supported releases of your software

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,640
and manually push those into the stable channel.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,800
Users looking for stability over the latest features

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,960
can subscribe to that channel.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,700
Your CI and QA team can subscribe to edge

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,480
to get the very latest builds automatically.

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,920
During prerelease you can use the beta channel

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,700
to deliver a new version to your testing team

17
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,700
prior to release.

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,680
Users can opt-in to the beta channel during this period,

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,360
and when testing is complete and you are ready to release,

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,040
they will move with you.

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,980
You can optionally use the candidate channel prior to release also.

22
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,860
Channels are designed to be flexible and support your release process.

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,380
