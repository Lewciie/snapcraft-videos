Snapcraft makes it easy to package and distribute your node applications to Linux users.

If you don't already have the snapcraft command, you'll need to install it. Link in the description.

First we’ll check the application name is available in the store, and register it for our use.

snapcraft register wethr

If the name is taken, don’t worry. Choose another one. Now we’ll create a template snapcraft yaml which we’ll edit to describe the application.

snapcraft init

Add in the metadata users will see when searching the store for your application. If you had to register a different name earlier, be sure to use it here.

name: wethr
version: master
summary: Command line weather tool.
description: |
  Get current weather:-
    $ wethr
  Get current weather in metric units
    $ wethr --metric
  Get current weather in imperial units
    $ wethr --imperial

Now, add a part to describe how your application is built.

parts:
  wethr:
    plugin: nodejs
    source: https://github.com/twobucks/wethr.git


We use the nodejs plugin. Snapcraft knows how to handle nodejs applications.

We’ll start with devmode which means the application isn’t confined. We can tighten that up later.

confinement: devmode
grade: devel


Finally we add an app stanza to define the commands contained in the snap.

apps:
  wethr:
    command: wethr

That’s it. Now we can create the snap with the snapcraft command.

snapcraft

Install and test the unsigned package locally with snap install

snap install wethr_master_amd64.snap --dangerous --devmode

..and push it to the store with snapcraft push...

snapcraft push wethr_master_amd64.snap --release edge

Great! Now you can tell your community to snap install --channel=edge --devmode wethr.
