In the previous video we snapped a nodejs application and pushed it to the edge channel in the store.

Users will typically install releases of applications from the stable channel however.

To land our snap in the stable channel, we need to make a couple of small changes.

We need to set the grade to stable. The store will only allow snaps graded as stable into the stable channel.

grade: stable

Now we will switch to strict confinement.

confinement: strict

You can find out more about grades and confinement models in our documentation, linked in the video description.

Now our application is securely confined, it will be cut off from the network. We can request network access to the ‘network’ interface via a plug, added to the command.

apps:
  wethr:
    command: wethr
    plugs: [network]

The up to date list of plugs and what resources they allow access to, is in the snapcraft documentation, also linked below.

That’s it, now we can rebuild the now-confined snap

snapcraft

Installing locally now no-longer requires the --devmode flag.

snap install wethr_master_amd64.snap --dangerous

Finally we can push to the beta channel and request our community test the snap

snapcraft push wethr_master_amd64.snap --release beta

or push directly to the stable channel..

snapcraft push wethr_master_amd64.snap --release stable

Great! Now you can tell the community to snap install wethr.
